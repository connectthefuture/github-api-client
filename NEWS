github-api-client NEWS -- history of user-visible changes
updated at 2011/01/30

Version 0.4.0.pre
* This version serves the purpose of showing new features and new design that github-api-client implemented recently
* New design
  focuses on splitting the logic into:
    - Models (backend)      - generally hidden from end-user
    - Fetchers (frontend)   - retrieve data from the site and store them locally using strategies
      * Strategy            - defines when to refresh data
    - Resources (frontend)  - light objects with @attributes hash and defined accessors for fields (also for editable fields)

* Resource description
  classes like Repository or User are now inheriting from Resource class which generates accessor methods for them and more

* Fully dynamic models and migrations generation
  taking advantage from using Resource classes to describe API resources, migrations now create tables for every resource
  models also include associations defined in Resource classes
